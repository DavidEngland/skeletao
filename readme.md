skeletao
========

"Skeletao" should be considered a scaffold or template for building stylesheets.

It is based on three different projects:

* [{less}][lesscss]: a css preprocessor
* [skeleton][skeleton]: a css responsive boilerplate
* [contao][contao]: a content management system

All three projects are selected by personal taste ;-)


What it is
----------

This is a collection of files for building the css for the [contao cms][contao] using the [{less}][lesscss] preprocessor and the basic style and responsiveness from [skeleton][skeleton].


What it isn't
-------------

It is definitely not a "use this and you've got a beautiful site" thingy.


"Holy Grail Layout" and responsiveness
--------------------------------------

The contao cms layout is build around the ["holy-grail-layout"][holygrail], the skeleton boilerplate on the other hand does specify a grid based system. For skeletao, the grid system was removed and the holy-grail-layout adopted to use breakpoints derived from skeleton.

The holy-grail-layout defines three columns that should be aligned side by side: left (mostly used for navigation), main and right (e.g. for additional info). In skeletao there are the following breakpoints defined:

1. smaller than 550px: all columns appear in full width, one below the other
2. larger than 550px: left and main column appear side by side, right column in full width below
3. larger than 750px: all three columns are aligned next to each other
4. larger than 970px: the content has a width of 960px and is centered

All these measurements are variables, so they are easy to adopt.


Files
-----

In order of loading:

* `index.less`: 'root'-file, combining all the others
* `_vars.less`: all definitions of variables
* `normalize.css`: element and attribute style-[normalizations][normalize]
* `styles.less`: basic styles, mostly derived from skeleton
* `holy-grail-layout.less`: the adopted holy-grail-layout
* `contao.less`: basic styles for contao
* `_custom.less`: a place for custom styles
* `contao/*`: files showing what *could* be styled in the contao frontend; propably not everything is needed - this is more a kind of a reminder of the structure of different contao elements.

Usage
-----

Mostly only the `_vars.less`, `_custom.less` and `contao/*` files need to be edited. But this is only a rule of thumb.

For development I use this command: `lessc index.less output.css`

For production I change `@media (min-width:` to `@media (min-device-width:` in all files and use the `--clean-css` switch on the `lessc` command: `lessc --clean-css index.less output.css`.
